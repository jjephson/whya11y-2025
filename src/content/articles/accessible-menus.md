Accessible menus are essential for users who rely on keyboards or assistive technology. Make sure your menus are navigable and usable for everyone.

- Use semantic HTML for menu structure.
- Ensure all menu items are reachable via keyboard.
- Provide clear focus indicators.

# Accessible Menus

Navigation menus should be usable by everyone, including keyboard and screen reader users. Use semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and ensure all menu items are reachable by keyboard.
