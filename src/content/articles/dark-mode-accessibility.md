Dark mode has become increasingly popular, but it's crucial to ensure it's implemented accessibly. This article covers the key considerations for creating an accessible dark mode experience.

## Why Dark Mode Matters for Accessibility

Dark mode isn't just about aestheticsâ€”it can significantly improve the experience for users with certain visual conditions and those working in low-light environments.

## Key Implementation Considerations

### 1. Maintain Sufficient Contrast

Even in dark mode, text must meet WCAG contrast requirements:
- Normal text: 4.5:1 ratio minimum
- Large text: 3:1 ratio minimum

### 2. Respect User Preferences

Always respect the user's system-level dark mode preference:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Dark mode styles */
}
```

### 3. Provide Manual Toggle

Give users control over their experience with a manual toggle option.

## Best Practices

- Test contrast ratios in both light and dark modes
- Ensure all interactive elements remain visible
- Consider users with color vision deficiencies
- Provide smooth transitions between modes
