Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessible web content. Using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose helps assistive technologies and browsers understand the structure and meaning of your content.

- Use headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`) to outline your document structure.
- Use `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and other landmarks appropriately.
