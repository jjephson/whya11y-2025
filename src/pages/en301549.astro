		<h1>EN 301 549: European Accessibility Standard</h1>
	
	<p>EN 301 549 is a comprehensive European standard that specifies the functional accessibility requirements for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products and services. This harmonized standard is crucial for ensuring digital accessibility across the European Union and has become a global benchmark for accessibility compliance, influencing policies and practices worldwide.</p>
	
	<h2>What is EN 301 549?</h2>
	<p>EN 301 549 is a harmonized European standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in collaboration with CEN (European Committee for Standardization) and CENELEC (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization). The standard defines detailed accessibility requirements for ICT products and services, serving as the foundation for the European Accessibility Act (EAA) and other EU accessibility legislation.</p>
	
	<p>The standard was first published in 2014 and has been regularly updated to reflect evolving technology and accessibility needs. The current version incorporates WCAG 2.1 guidelines while adding specific requirements for hardware, software, and documentation that go beyond web content.</p>
	
	<h2>Scope and Coverage</h2>
	<p>EN 301 549 covers a wide range of ICT products and services, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Websites and web applications</strong> - Including e-commerce, government services, and educational platforms</li>
		<li><strong>Mobile applications</strong> - Native and web-based mobile apps</li>
		<li><strong>Software applications</strong> - Desktop software, enterprise applications, and productivity tools</li>
		<li><strong>Hardware devices</strong> - Computers, tablets, smartphones, and other ICT equipment</li>
		<li><strong>Documentation and support</strong> - User manuals, help systems, and customer support services</li>
		<li><strong>Electronic documents</strong> - PDFs, Word documents, and other digital content</li>
		<li><strong>Communication services</strong> - Email, messaging, and video conferencing platforms</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Core Accessibility Principles</h2>
	<p>EN 301 549 is built around four fundamental accessibility principles, adapted from WCAG 2.1:</p>
	
	<h3>1. Perceivable</h3>
	<p>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive, regardless of their sensory abilities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Text alternatives for non-text content (images, videos, audio)</li>
		<li>Captions and audio descriptions for multimedia content</li>
		<li>Content that can be presented in different ways without losing structure</li>
		<li>Sufficient color contrast and visual distinction</li>
		<li>Text that can be resized up to 200% without loss of functionality</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>2. Operable</h3>
	<p>User interface components and navigation must be operable by all users:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Full keyboard accessibility for all functionality</li>
		<li>Sufficient time for users to read and use content</li>
		<li>No content that could cause seizures or physical reactions</li>
		<li>Clear navigation mechanisms and wayfinding</li>
		<li>Input modalities beyond keyboard (voice, gesture, etc.)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>3. Understandable</h3>
	<p>Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Readable and predictable text content</li>
		<li>Consistent navigation and identification</li>
		<li>Input assistance and error prevention</li>
		<li>Clear error messages and recovery options</li>
		<li>Logical content structure and relationships</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>4. Robust</h3>
	<p>Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Valid markup and coding standards</li>
		<li>Compatibility with current and future assistive technologies</li>
		<li>Proper use of accessibility APIs and standards</li>
		<li>Fallback mechanisms for unsupported features</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Compliance Levels</h2>
	<p>EN 301 549 defines three levels of compliance, each representing increasing levels of accessibility:</p>
	
	<h3>Level A (Basic)</h3>
	<p>The minimum level of accessibility that should be achieved. Level A compliance addresses the most critical accessibility barriers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Basic keyboard navigation</li>
		<li>Simple text alternatives for images</li>
		<li>Basic form labels and controls</li>
		<li>No keyboard traps</li>
		<li>Basic color contrast requirements</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Level AA (Enhanced)</h3>
	<p>The most commonly required level for public sector and many private sector organizations. Level AA provides a good balance of accessibility and implementation effort:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text</li>
		<li>3:1 contrast ratio for large text</li>
		<li>Captions for all pre-recorded audio content</li>
		<li>Audio descriptions for video content</li>
		<li>Logical heading structure</li>
		<li>Consistent navigation</li>
		<li>Error identification and suggestions</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Level AAA (Advanced)</h3>
	<p>The highest level of accessibility, providing the most comprehensive user experience. Level AAA is typically required for specialized accessibility services:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>7:1 contrast ratio for normal text</li>
		<li>4.5:1 contrast ratio for large text</li>
		<li>Sign language interpretation for audio content</li>
		<li>Extended audio descriptions</li>
		<li>No timing restrictions</li>
		<li>Enhanced error prevention</li>
		<li>Reading level appropriate for secondary education</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>European Accessibility Act (EAA) Integration</h2>
	<p>EN 301 549 is directly referenced in the European Accessibility Act (Directive 2019/882), which requires certain products and services to be accessible by 2025. The EAA applies to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Public sector websites and mobile applications</li>
		<li>E-commerce platforms</li>
		<li>Banking services</li>
		<li>Transportation services</li>
		<li>Educational services</li>
		<li>Healthcare services</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Organizations providing these services must ensure compliance with EN 301 549 Level AA requirements, making this standard essential for business operations in the EU market.</p>
	
	<h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>
